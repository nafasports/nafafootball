          <h3>OFFENCE</h3>
          <h3>QUARTERBACK (QB)</h3>
          <p>
            Quarterback is the most recognised position in American Football, A
            Quarterback is the leader of the team and takes on responsibility
            for the Offence’s performance. The Quarterback gets most of the
            media attention in the NFL, often making them superstars.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Quarterback calls the plays in the huddle and once the Offence
            is set in the right formation, he calls out the coded signals (also
            called the “cadence”) that let his team-mates know when the ball
            will be snapped or if he is changing the play. Once the ball is
            snapped the QB can either hand off or pitch the ball to a Running
            Back, Pass (throw) the ball to a Wide Receiver, Tight End or
            sometimes a Running Back, or run with the ball himself (although QBs
            don’t do this often!). Quarterback’s must know what every player is
            assigned to do on every single play in the Offence’s playbook. They
            must have a strong arm, nerves of steel (waiting for the perfect
            moment to throw whilst defenders are charging towards him takes
            courage!) and must have the respect of their team-mates.
          </p>
          <h3>RUNNING BACK (RB)</h3>
          <p>
            These players are the workhorses of the Offence; they perform many
            duties including running the ball (also known as rushing), catching
            passes and blocking defenders. They must be very fast and agile as
            well as being tough enough to withstand the punishment they must
            endure on most plays.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once the QB hands off to them at the start of a running play it’s up
            to the Running Back to find room created by the Offensive Line to
            run through…after that it’s a simple matter of avoiding 11 angry
            Defensive players on the way to the Endzone! Fullbacks (FB) are
            generally big Running Backs, with good catching ability but are
            mainly used to “lead block” for the other Running Back, leading the
            way on running plays, taking on Linebackers to clear a path for
            their team-mate.
          </p>
          <h3>WIDE RECEIVERS (WR)</h3>
          <p>
            Receivers are fast and agile. With great catching ability, they run
            specific pass patterns (or routes) designed to take them to a
            designated area of the field and help them elude defenders who are
            covering them – running specific routes means the QB knows before
            the ball is snapped where his Receivers are going to be (or should
            be!) on each play.
          </p>
          <p>
            A Receiver must be able to catch the ball no matter what the
            circumstance, even if he knows he will be hit hard by a defender as
            soon as the ball is in his grasp. As American coaches are fond of
            saying, Receivers will end up getting hit on the play anyway, so
            they might as well catch the ball too!
          </p>
          <h3>TIGHT END (TE)</h3>
          <p>
            The Tight End is a combination of the pass catching skills of a
            Receiver with the blocking ability and strength of a Lineman. They
            are versatile players who can run pass patterns on one play and can
            then be called on to block for a Running Back on the next. The Tight
            End usually lines up outside a Tackle on either the left or right of
            the Offensive formation. The side the TE lines up on is called the
            strongside by the Defence.
          </p>
          <h3>OFFENSIVE LINEMEN (O-LINE)</h3>
          <p>
            The Offensive Line Must act as immovable objects on passing plays,
            protecting the QB by blocking the Defence that are trying to get to
            him before he passes the ball. On Running plays they become the
            irresistible force, surging forwards to push defenders out of the
            way and create room for Running Backs to sprint through.
          </p>
          <p>
            This “Five Man Army” – must act as a unit, each of them knowing
            their own assignments as well as what the other linemen will do on
            each play or when the Defence suddenly shifts formation. The Centre
            (C) is the only player on the field apart from the QB who handles
            the ball on every play. He must snap the ball to the QB on the right
            verbal signal, making sure the ball gets to the Quarterback’s hands
            smoothly, all the while looking at the Defence and the Defensive
            Linemen opposite who are primed to attack. The Guards (G) line up
            either side of the Centre, with a Tackle (T) on the outside of each
            Guard. Left to right, it is Tackle, Guard, Centre, Guard, Tackle.
          </p>
          <p>
            Guards and Tackles must be equally good at run blocking, where they
            try to force defenders out of the way and create a “hole” for the
            Running Back, and pass blocking, where they form a wall of blockers
            around the Quarterback to give him time to make the throw (creating
            a space or “pocket” for the QB). Offensive Linemen are the unsung
            heroes of the team, as they do a tough job but rarely get
            recognition for it. Every other position has statistics to show how
            well they have performed, whether it’s number of yards gained
            rushing for Running Backs, or number of tackles by any defensive
            player, all except the O-Line get the numbers to talk about.
          </p>
          <h3>DEFENCE</h3>
          <h4>DEFENSIVE LINEMEN (D-LINE)</h4>
          <p>
            Many people get confused by the two lines in American Football,
            thinking that the Defensive Line protects the Quarterback. Nothing
            could be further from the truth, as these players are the first in
            line to try and get to the QB, or whichever unlucky “target” has the
            ball on the play. Defensive Linemen can be either Defensive Ends
            (DE) or Defensive Tackles (DT). As the name implies, the End plays
            on the end of the Defensive Line, the Defensive Tackle is between
            the Ends. In a 4-3 formation, there are 2 DEs and 2 DTs, in a 3-4
            formation, there are 2 DEs and 1 DT, sometimes called the Nose
            Tackle (NT) because he plays right in front of the Centre.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just as Offensive Linemen must be good both run and pass blocking,
            Defensive Linemen must be equally good at pass rushing (getting
            through the O-Line to the Quarterback) and stopping the running
            plays. In this way, they must also alternate between irresistible
            force and immovable object! The battles between both lines are
            intense and violent, as no matter what play it is, these large,
            strong aggressive players are fighting it out.
          </p>
          <h3>LINEBACKERS (LB)</h3>
          <p>
            Linebackers must be versatile as they have several responsibilities.
            A Linebacker may be called upon to rush the QB on a pass, or drop
            back and cover a Receiver running a pattern. On some plays they must
            watch for Running backs darting through any holes in the lines. With
            these tasks in mind, they must be fast and agile enough to cover
            Offensive players running patterns but they must also be strong
            enough to take on big Fullbacks and Offensive Linemen who try to
            block them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Linebackers can play in a variety of positions; Middle Linebackers
            (MLB) are responsible for the centre of the field and typically must
            be big enough to take on Running Backs charging straight at them
            through the lines. Outside Linebackers (OLB) have the perimeters of
            the field to cover, and must watch for Tight Ends and speedy Running
            Backs. In a 3-4 formation, there are 4 Linebackers, 2 at outside and
            2 inside. Teams can use this formation to confuse an Offence and
            have more players available to Blitz.
          </p>
          <h3>CORNERBACKS (CB)</h3>
          <p>
            The Cornerback is the Defence’s answer to Wide Receivers. Corners
            must cover Receivers when they are running their patterns and ensure
            that they make a tackle as soon as the Receiver makes a catch.
            Better still, is when a Cornerback can Intercept a pass intended for
            a Receiver. Should a Receiver score a Touchdown however, it can be a
            long walk back to the huddle for the Cornerback who got “burned” on
            the play.
          </p>
          <p>
            They must be every bit as fast and agile as a Receiver, but have a
            harder job as they often run backwards at first to stay focused on
            the Receiver. Cornerbacks must also be strong (and brave enough) to
            take on bigger players like Running Backs should they elude the
            other members of the Defence.
          </p>
          <h3>SAFETIES (S)</h3>
          <p>
            The Safety’s motto is “if everyone else misses, don’t miss.” They
            are the last line of Defence but are sometimes the first to attack,
            with a brutal combination of speed and power they are combinations
            of Linebackers and Cornerbacks, with the ability to cover Receivers
            and bring down Running Backs. There are normally 2 Safeties on the
            field; the Strong Safety (SS) will line up on the same side as the
            Tight End and will cover him, the Free Safety (FS) is free to move
            to where he is needed in coverage.
          </p>

          <h3>SPECIALISTS</h3>
          <h4>KICKER (K)</h4>

          <p>
            The player who kicks the ball on kickoffs, extra point attempts, and
            field goal attempts. A Kicker either kicks the ball while it’s being
            held by a teammate or kicks it off a tee.
          </p>
          <h3>HOLDER</h3>
          <p>
            The player who catches the snap from the Centre and places it down
            for the Kicker to attempt to kick it through the uprights of the
            goalpost. On an attempted field goal, the holder must catch the ball
            and put it into a good kicking position, ideally with the laces
            facing away from the kicker. This must be a player with great
            catching ability, or used to handling the ball. Often a back-up QB,
            or the Punter.
          </p>
          <h3>KICK RETURNER (KR)</h3>
          <p>
            The kick returner is the player that catches kickoffs and attempts
            to return them in the opposite direction. He is usually one of the
            faster players on the team, often a Wide Receiver.
          </p>
          <h3>PUNTER (P)</h3>
          <p>
            The player who stands behind the line of scrimmage, catches the long
            snap from the Centre, and then kicks the ball after dropping it
            toward his foot. The punter generally comes in on fourth down to
            punt the ball to the other team with the idea of driving the other
            team as far back as possible before they take possession of the
            ball.
          </p>
          <h3>LONG SNAPPER (LS)</h3>
          <p>
            The Centre position as it would be played on Offence, but this
            player specializes in making longer snaps for punts and field goal
            attempts. A Long-Snapper generally has to snap the ball
            seven-to-eight yards behind him with the accuracy that allows the
            Holder or Punter to handle the ball cleanly.
          </p>
          <h3>PUNT RETURNER (PR)</h3>
          <p>
            The job of a Punt Returner is to catch the ball after it has been
            punted and run it back toward the punting team’s end zone.
          </p>
          <h3>GUNNER</h3>
          <p>
            The members of the special teams who specialize in racing downfield
            to tackle the Punt Returner. The Gunners usually line up on the
            outside of the Offensive Line and are often double teamed by
            blockers. Must be fast as well as good at tackling. Often Defensive
            Backs.
