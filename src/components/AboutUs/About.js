                  The American Football Association of Nigeria is a
                  nongovernmental organization which operates as NAFA in
                  Nigeria. It is an association created to promote and growth
                  across the 36 states of the federation [including the FCT] the
                  contact and noncontact American Football. This is currently
                  done under the NFFL AND NAFL brand, in partnership with the
                  international federation IFAF.
                </p>
                <h3>Founding - NAFA</h3>
                <p>
                  Founded n November 2019 by Babajide Akeredolu, NAFA was
                  created as a viable platform for interested Nigerian Youths to
                  use the sports for both personal and national development.
                  Having played the sport in the United States as a recreational
                  sport, Akeredolu alongside other founding members seek to
                  raise the standard of the sport in Nigeria, facilitating the
                  rise of the sport to rank alongside other prominent sports in
                  the country

                <h2>Vision</h2>
                <p>
                  Our vision is to create increased opportunities for Nigerians
                  through American football. Opportunities range from
                  educational scholarships through sport, provision of
                  livelihood, and exposure to diverse culture and tourism from
                  NAFA tours. We will be the first organization with a clear
                  intent to integrate Nigeria and Africa with the National
                  Football League (NFL) in America and other organizations
                  across the world.
